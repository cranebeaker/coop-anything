# Heat Signature (2017)

| | |
|---|---|
| Engine | GameMaker: Studio 1.4 (engine 1.4.1804), compiled with **YYC**; 32-bit; the data chunk (`FORM`/`GEN8`) is embedded in `Heat_Signature.exe`, there is no `data.win` |
| Versions tested | Steam app 268130, build 6124596 (in-game 2021.1.20.1), Windows build run under Proton Experimental on Linux. `Heat_Signature.exe` SHA-256 `a5f8befe28786206ed1e2a52385051049524fea51e9e80660e3115e7126274d2` |
| Projects | none yet; a from-zero mod is in progress (claim: issue 274) |
| QA level | none |

## Where things stand

Nobody can play Heat Signature together today. A co-op mod for up to 4 players is being built from zero. So far a
probe DLL loads into the game, hooks its compiled GML functions and reads the player and time state while the game runs.
There is no networking yet.

## Existing work

- No co-op or multiplayer mod found (web search 2026-10-30; GitHub, Nexus Mods, ModDB, Steam Workshop and forums).
- The [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268130/Heat_Signature/) says there is no multiplayer. Forum
  threads asking for co-op: [1](https://steamcommunity.com/app/268130/discussions/0/144512526678821083/),
  [2](https://steamcommunity.com/app/268130/discussions/0/1520386297686058374/).
- A small modding scene exists: a QoL mod on Nexus needs a "Heat Signature Mod Loader"
  ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/heatsignature/mods/4)). How that loader works is unknown.

## How the game works (for co-op)

- **Code:** YYC, so there is no GML in the data chunk. Each compiled function stores a pointer to its own name
  (`gml_Script_PlayerCreate`, `gml_Object_oPlayer_Step_0`) on its stack frame. Matching those `mov [esp+disp], imm32`
  instructions to the name strings binds 2504 of 2562 names to functions. Ghidra 12.1.2 then decompiles them one by one
  without a full auto-analysis (the full analysis of the 73 MB exe takes hours). Details in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).
- **Variables:** a `{name, id}` table in `.data` names 3200 instance and global variable slots. Globals sit on one
  global instance; `global.Player` is slot 5 and holds the player's instance id as a real.
- **One player:** a single `oPlayer`, reached through `global.Player`. The same pattern as Forager.
- **Time:** the player can pause at any time, and there is slow motion and fast-forward (`TimeScale`, `SlowMo`,
  `FastMo`). Co-op needs a rule; the plan is a shared pause.
- **Saves:** `%APPDATA%\Heat_Signature`. The galaxy is a plain-text file, and each character is its own ~2 KB file with
  base64 lines and a checksum. A guest can bring their own character file to the host.
- **Steam:** the game initialises `steam_api.dll` and does not reach its first room without a running Steam client.
- **Injection:** the exe imports only three functions from `VERSION.dll`, so a `version.dll` proxy loads the mod (under
  Proton with `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=version=n,b`).

## What we changed

Nothing in the game. A read-only probe DLL (MinHook) logs player, time and pause state.

## QA

None yet. The plan is an in-game bot that drives the player through the game's own control scripts.

## How to play

Not playable yet.

## Known issues

Not applicable yet.

## Next steps

- Map input (`ControlDown`, `ControlPressed`, `ControlReleased`, mouse aim) and drive it from the DLL. This gives both
  remote players and a test bot.
- Read the pause, slow-motion and fast-forward code in a mission and design the shared pause.
- Netcode: the host runs the simulation, guests send input and get state, over Steam lobbies and P2P, up to 4 players.
