## Where things stand

Nobody can play Heat Signature together yet, but the core pieces of a co-op mod for up to 4 players run between two
game copies on one PC (localhost UDP, headless test displays). Working and tested with bot input: each player sees the
other as a puppet character or pod; shared pause, slow motion and fast-forward with a "paused by" banner; the host's
mission and its ship are rebuilt identically on the guest from the mission text plus a seed; pods fly together in
space (with an optional "follow the host" mode) and both players can board the shared ship; doors and guard positions
are synced from the host, and the host's guards notice guests. Not done: guests' attacks reaching the host, guard
animations on guests, keycards, alarms, loot, more than one guest, Steam lobbies, an installer.

## Existing work

- No co-op or multiplayer mod found (web search 2026-10-30; GitHub, Nexus Mods, ModDB, Steam Workshop and forums).
- The [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268130/Heat_Signature/) says there is no multiplayer. Forum
  threads asking for co-op: [1](https://steamcommunity.com/app/268130/discussions/0/144512526678821083/),
  [2](https://steamcommunity.com/app/268130/discussions/0/1520386297686058374/).
- A small modding scene exists: a QoL mod on Nexus needs a "Heat Signature Mod Loader"
  ([Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/heatsignature/mods/4)). How that loader works is unknown.

## How the game works (for co-op)

- **Code:** YYC, so there is no GML in the data chunk. Each compiled function stores a pointer to its own name
  (`gml_Script_PlayerCreate`, `gml_Object_oPlayer_Step_0`) on its stack frame. Matching those `mov [esp+disp], imm32`
  instructions to the name strings binds 2504 of 2562 names to functions. Ghidra 12.1.2 then decompiles them one by one
  without a full auto-analysis (the full analysis of the 73 MB exe takes hours). Details in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).
- **Variables:** a `{name, id}` table in `.data` names 3200 instance and global variable slots. Globals sit on one
  global instance; `global.Player` is slot 5 and holds the player's instance id as a real.
- **One player:** a single `oPlayer`, reached through `global.Player`. The same pattern as Forager.
- **Time:** the player can pause at any time, and there is slow motion and fast-forward (`TimeScale`, `SlowMo`,
  `FastMo`). Co-op needs a rule; the plan is a shared pause.
- **Saves:** `%APPDATA%\Heat_Signature`. The galaxy is a plain-text file, and each character is its own ~2 KB file with
  base64 lines and a checksum. A guest can bring their own character file to the host.
- **Steam:** the game initialises `steam_api.dll` and does not reach its first room without a running Steam client.
- **Injection:** the exe imports only three functions from `VERSION.dll`, so a `version.dll` proxy loads the mod (under
  Proton with `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=version=n,b`).

## What we changed

Nothing in the game files. The mod is two DLLs next to the exe: `version.dll`, a permanent loader (keeps the game
running unfocused, logs and answers error dialogs in test copies, hosts the hot-reload core) and `coop_core.dll`,
swapped while the game runs. Each mechanism, the evidence and the numbers are in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

## QA

None yet. The plan is an in-game bot that drives the player through the game's own control scripts.

## How to play

Not playable yet.

## Known issues

Not applicable yet.

## Next steps

- Spotted pause/zoom on the spotted player's screen; guests' hits and knockouts sent to the host; guard states and
  animations on guests; keycard clearance and alarms; loot.
- Up to 3 guests, Steam lobbies and invites, mission sharing from the game's own menus.
- An automated QA suite (two or more headless copies, bots, assertions), then an installer.
